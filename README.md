Fantasy Football Data Scraping and Analytic Repository

In this repository, you will currently find three files:

1. ESPN Selenium Scrape
2. Free Agent Scrape
3. Team Accronym csv

These files will allow you to scrape data from ESPN fantasy football data (but could be edited for all other sports). 
The selenium scrape file is designed to scrape the teams on your team or within your fantasy league. There are certain areas where you will need to type in your
ESPN log in credentials to work, so be sure to do that. 

The second counts all free agents available within your league. This is useful if you are trying to analyze players to pick up.

Overall, you will need to verify which week your are pulling from within the Selenium browser on occasion, if you have not hard coded that selection. 

If you want to collect data for all teams in your league, you can simply change the scrape into a loop that goes through all teams in your league. 

Good luck and let me know of any analytics you do!
